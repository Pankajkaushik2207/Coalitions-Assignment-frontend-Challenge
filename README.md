## Description: 


This submission showcases my proficiency test for the front-end role at Coalition Technologies. The aim of this evaluation is to assess my ability to translate an Adobe Photoshop design into a static, one-page web application. The primary objective remains to convert the provided PSD into a responsive single-page website. This involves ensuring the seamless adaptation of the carousel to various screen sizes, and for mobile devices, implementing a smooth transition of the tabs into an accordion layout to enhance usability.

Additionally, I've integrated internal page links for 'History' and 'Team,' offering users easy access to their respective sections. Moreover, I've taken the initiative to add a parallax scrolling effect to the landing hero image specifically for the desktop view.
